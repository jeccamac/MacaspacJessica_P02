INNOVATION
	I wanted the level to standout and created a small but fun area to manuever around. Similar to the first part of the project,
	the stamina drains when you sprint and I also utilized the key/door unlock areas and also a key that enables the shields at the 
	end that block turret gunfire. Instead of a particle effect for the bullet, I created a trail so that you can see the direction
	of where you are shooting. I created healing items, the stationary turret enemies and also the bombs that track the player.
	There's also a separate deathCam for when the player dies and pulls up the deathHUD with buttons that restarts the level or to
	go back to the main menu.

DIFFICULTIES
	Mouse sensitivity slider and Volume slider still not working, and Paused doesn't stop enemies from shooting player. I tried to 
	put particles on the enemies that can be enabled when its taking damage, but I couldn't get it to work. Alternatively I also
	tried putting impact particles on the point of hit impact but it also didn't work because the instantiate prefab wouldn't take
	in Vector3 I think? So I just played sounds for when the turrets take damage.
